# MERN Project Scafold

## Starting your MERN stack project just got a little easier :smiley:

- To scafold your MERN stack project, create a directory on your local machine and run:

```js
node scafold
```

- Enter your project directory path in the prompt "Enter project directory path >>> "

- Change directory into your project directory:

- Change directory into the "client" sub directory and run:

```js
npm run dev
```

- Change directory into the "server" sub directory:

- Add your mongodb database connection string to the ".env" file and run:

```js
npm run start
```

Just like that! your basic nodeJS/Express server is set up with mongoose!!!

query your server endpoints at

```js
http://localhost:7000/
```

```js
http://localhost:7000/favfruits
```

Hooray! happy coding ðŸ‘‹
